GSM Data Generator is a library for generating and processing structured datasets for GSM, USIM, and eSIM systems. It is designed to bridge the gap between telecom operator requirements and developer productivity, offering flexible tools for data parsing, formatting, and export. The library provides an extensible framework to define operator-specific templates, process large-scale inputs, and generate outputs in standardized formats for downstream telecom systems.

Data Generation is licensed under the [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) license.

Getting Started
---------------
Check out the [Data Generation Documentation]() site for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.
The [Getting Started with Data Generation]() tutorial is a great
place to start.

Features
--------
Synthetic GSM data generation, Operator-specific templates, Data output in various formats


Contribute to Data Generation
-----------------
Data Generation adopts the Apache committer model. We aim to create an open-source project maintained and owned by the community.

History and Acknowledgement
---------------------------
Data Generation started as a research project for USIM, ESIM etc.
<!-- The first version of the project benefited a lot from the following projects:

- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
 originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some parts of the lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence. -->

Since then, the project has gone through several rounds of redesigns.
The current design is also drastically different from the initial design, following the
development trend of the community.
